# MMC Season v7 Development Trust Fund:

## Introduction

With the help of the community, weâ€™ve raised $100,000 and are close to the end of the funding cycle.

Thanks to the community, we have a functioning and tested implementation of MMC that provides strong performance, security, and user experience.

We are developing MMC in our open source repository. Any changes to the functionality or design are committed back to the main branch.

The core team is still working on additional features and improvements to MMC. These will not be made available to the general public until the next funding round.

We are not releasing MMC until all funding requirements have been met. We will make MMC available for free to the community, and are committed to releasing a stable version of the application.

## **Current Milestones**

$75,000 funded:

**MMC v7.5**
The current iteration of MMC provides many new features, performance improvements, and security improvements.

MMC v7.5 will have the following features:
Improved user experience for a better browsing experience
Added a new option to delete a comment
Added a new option to add an existing comment
Added a new option to enable/disable an auto clicker
Added new functionality to manage an auto clicker

MMC v7.5: New auto clicker settings

A new auto clicker settings page has been added to MMC. This will give you the ability to control the setting of an auto clicker in MMC. MMC will be default set to a setting where each page is auto clicked if you are scrolling through all of the comments on a page. This is a new feature that is currently being tested and will be released in a future version of MMC.

# Trust Fund Participation
